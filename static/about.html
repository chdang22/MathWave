                        <p>MathWave began with a vision: to transform how children experience and learn mathematics. 
                            Founded in 2018 by Alice Johnson, a former mathematics teacher with a passion for educational technology, our journey started in a small, vibrant office in downtown Seattle. 
                            Alice's dream was to create a platform where math isn't just a subject, but a world of fun and interactive challenges.</p>

                        <h2>What We Do</h2>
                        <p>At MathWave, we are at the forefront of educational innovation, harnessing the power of brainwave data to revolutionize the learning experience. Our unique approach involves using advanced algorithms driven by real-time brainwave feedback to curate personalized learning content. This method allows us to tailor the educational experience to each student's attention span, learning pace, and cognitive responses.</p>
                        <p>Our platform goes beyond traditional teaching methods by integrating brainwave tracking technology. This enables us to monitor key indicators such as attention levels and cognitive load, ensuring that each learning session is optimized for maximum engagement and effectiveness. By adapting to each student's individual needs, we create a learning environment that is not only more efficient but also deeply engaging and responsive to their mental state.</p>
                        <p>MathWave's mission is to make learning a truly adaptive and interactive experience. We believe that by understanding and responding to the brain's feedback, we can unlock a new realm of personalized education, making learning more intuitive, enjoyable, and impactful for students everywhere.</p>
